The folder contains scripts to model tabular data using the Titanic survival database. The database can be collected from here: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

The two Kaggle notebooks present NN models to predict the survival rate using passengers' information. The scripts are based on the FastAi course

titanic-survival-pred-scratch.py:
Traditional machine learning with Scikit-learn. Manual feature engineering and interpretable models like logistic regression.


titanic-survival-pred-fastai.py:
Deep learning with fastai. Automated preprocessing, neural networks, and advanced training techniques for potentially higher accuracy.
