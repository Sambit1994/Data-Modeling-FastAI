The folder contains scripts to model tabular data using the Titanic survival data. The dataset can be collected from here: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

The two Kaggle notebooks present NN models to predict the survival rate using passengers' information. The scripts are based on the FastAI course
