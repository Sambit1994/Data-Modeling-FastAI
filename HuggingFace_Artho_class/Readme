The artho-train model creates an image model for classifying arthropods using collected images

It is based on the 'convnext_small' image model in the timm library; So, pip install and import if not already done

The artho-app uses Gradio to create a temporary webpage to test the app

A space using Huggingface server is made to run the app: https://sambit94-arthopod-classifier.hf.space/?__theme=system&deep_link=_el2dhGuEqo
