# Data-Modeling
Data modeling using fast.ai and PyTorch

Contains various scripts to use Fast.ai and PyTorch for data modeling  

Original scripts are linked from Kaggle

1) fastai-random-image-analysis.ipynb: Distinguish a picture as Human, Plant, Animal, or inanimate
   
2) artho-traning-models.ipynb: Train various models for classifying an arthropod picture under the categories: Arachnida, Crustacea, Insecta, Chilopoda, Diplopoda

3) Titanic Survival Prediction: Predicting survivors in the Titanic tragedy. The folder contains various ML and deep-learning routines(scripts) and uses the Kaggle competition dataset  

4) Paddy Disease Classification: Showcases different examples of transfer learning to predict diseased paddy from a collected image dataset
